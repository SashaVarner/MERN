#MERN
This project is my final project for Towson University.

To start it, type npm run server. (Make sure you're in the DevConnector folder)

### `npm run dev`

This is Sasha's created script that runs with concurrently. This makes it so that both the backend and the frontend can run at the same time (concurrently).
